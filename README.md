A sample Unity code and project with a typewriter effect. Written for this Medium article of mine, [Typewriter text effect in Unity: You might be doing wrong](https://medium.com/@ahmetkamilkele/typewriter-text-effect-in-unity-you-might-be-doing-wrong-5e78f21b3494)  

This sample showcases two approaches:
1. Appending characters to a TextMeshPro text
2. Increasing the max visible characters of a TextMeshPro text

Appending characters is a commonly used, but a wrong approach that reduces the text readability and performance. The second approach eliminates those problems.
